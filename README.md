ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bgta, I'm a passionate about new technologies, self-taught and restless mind. 
I have been in the computer world since I was 12 years old. I am currently a DevOps Engineer [Leadtech ;)](https://leadtech.com/).

Open Source fan, GNU/Linux user from the 90â€™s and currently Ambassador of OpenSUSE in Spain. 
I love programming and above all looking for solutions to problems in the developments. 
I do not hesitate to learn new programming languages if they are a good option for new projects or out of curiosity.
